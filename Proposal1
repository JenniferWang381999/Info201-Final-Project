Info-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics

The Information School

University of Washington

Autumn 2019

### **1.0 Introduction**
1.1 _Problem Situation_

      Every year, a large number of people are moving to new locations for school and work.
      The very first problem they are facing is to find a suitable and affordable apartment or house to live in.
      Our goal for this project is to use open-source data and to find their best option.

1.2 _What is the problem?_

      Renting a home without physically seeing it before people move in is not ideal.
      People have limited time to gather information on the housing,
      and once they start digging into the details, they often feel overwhelmed by the information online.

1.3 _Why does it matter?_

      The problem we are trying to solve matters because it’s a real,
      urgent issue that most people are facing when they move to a new city.

1.4 _How it will be addressed?_

       We will collect our data from open source websites and mostly from Zillow.
       We will analyze and compare housing data for 5 major cities in the United States
       which includes Boston, NYC, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles

### **2.0 Research Question**
<Q1: What is the mean housing price in each city(Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, NYC and Boston) over a certain period of years, and the trend of the price over the term and predictions of the housing prices in the future?>

<Q2: What is the best month to buy a house in each of the 5 cities(Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, NYC and Boston)?>

### **3.0 Possible Data Set**
Zillow(Nation-wide) : https://www.zillow.com/research/data/
Government housing data(Nation-wide)
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS
https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/index.html
Price of housing monthly and quarterly https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx
LA Rent Price dataset : https://usc.data.socrata.com/Los-Angeles/Rent-Price-LA-/4a97-v5tx
NYC housing price dataset:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-New-York-Units-by-Building/hg8x-zxpr

### **4.0 Information Visualization**
![One information visualization we will be using is a geographic map because geography is an important aspect of the housing data we are collecting. One map will be of the United States and the areas(Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, NYC, and Boston) will be color-coded to reflect housing prices. There will be a feature to zoom in the map and navigate the coordinates. We want the map to look similar to the map below but with color fade instead in order to appropriately represent continuous variables.](pictures/map.jpg)

![We will have a line graph to show the mean housing price in the chosen cities over a certain period of years. The x-axis will be years and the y-axis will be price. We anticipate the line graph to look similar to this graph below. This will help us notice any important underlying trends in the data.

### **5.0 Team Coordination**
(a) We usually meet 2 hours a week and mostly from 5:00-7:00pm on either Thursdays or Fridays.

(b) Goal: We are trying to analyze and manipulate data using R, Tableau and Excel in order to help people find housing more effectively. And we separated the work equally, and we work as a team toward the goal.

(c) We communicate mostly using iMessage and we share a google doc. We also use Trello to keep track of our work.

(d) We value each other's feedback and we mostly give each other feedbacks in person.

### **6.0 Questions for Teaching Team**
<1. How can we make a map in order to see the housing distribution in the United States?>

<2. Should we narrow down to only 5 major cities?>

<3. Can we other software or visualization tools to complete the project, for example, Tableau ? >

<4. Should we only use csv.file?>
